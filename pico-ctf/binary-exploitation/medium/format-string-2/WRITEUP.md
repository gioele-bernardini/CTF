# Format String 2

## Solution

First off, let's download the *source code* and the *executable*. `file vuln` indicates that is an ELF 64-bit, where previously we exploited 32-bit executable. Stack segmentation, hence, might be different this time.

Once we take a look at the code, it is pretty straight-forward to understand that the `sus variable` must be overwritten:

I noticed that, compared to the previous time, now the stack does \*not\* contain the flag, so dump it, as far as I know with the informations so far, should be totally useless.

### Goal 1. Overwrite *sus* variable

How can we overwrite it?

Let's recap the ***Call stack*** and the ***x86 calling conventions*** with Wikipedia:
