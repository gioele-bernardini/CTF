# Verify

## Description

```
People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. I want to make sure they get the real thing! I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and a decrypt script to help you know that my flags are legitimate.
```

You are provided with an archive to download, which includes a decryption script, a text file with the checksum, and a folder containing various ASCII files.

## Hints

```
Checksums let you tell if a file is complete and from the original distributor. If the hash doesn't match, it's a different file.
```
```
You can create a SHA checksum of a file with sha256sum <file> or all files in a directory with sha256sum <directory>/*.
```
```
Remember you can pipe the output of one command to another with |. Try practicing with the 'First Grep' challenge if you're stuck!
