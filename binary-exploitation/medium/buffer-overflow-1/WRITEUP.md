# Solution

## Explanation

Solving this challenge requires a solid understanding of the underlying concepts, so reviewing the documentation in the `docs/` folder is essential.

One critical detail not mentioned in the documentation is that the byte order for the EIP value is reversed when dumped from the stack. This is because our system uses `little-endian` format, meaning the bytes of the dwords (or qwords, depending on whether the executable is 32 or 64-bit) are reversed.

To simplify the process, hereâ€™s a command line script that generates the payload needed to solve the challenge. The `xxd` tool in the pipeline ensures that the final value matches the one extracted from the stack dump for the *EIP*. You can extract this value using *readelf* or *gdb*:

```bash
python3 -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\xf6\x91\x04\x08')" | xxd
```
