# Solution

## Explanation

The challenge is a very straightforward first approach to the *buffer overflow* vulnerabilities.
Exceeding the buffer is all it takes to cause a `SIGSEGV` signal by the operating system, and the program will reveal the flag previous read from the file `flag.txt`.

The vulnerable function in the code is this:
```C
strcpy(buf2, input);
```

`strcpy` function does *not* check the size of the arguments, So
it is extremely dangerous.
