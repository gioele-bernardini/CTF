# Writeup

## Explanation

The challenge is pretty straightforward once you know how heap works.
Lets' recap the stack and heap layout:

Now, heap grows towards *bigger* addresses, that is way the second variabile is placed on a bigger address.
With exadecimal system in mind, we can easily calculate the distance - in terms of *bytes* (our addressing is baded on bytes!) between the two variables:

```
= 16 (bytes)
```

Since we know that a unicode char is exatly **1 byte long**, we know for sure that, in order to overwrite the content of the second variabile, we have to write 16 + 1 (be careful here! one - fence errors!) characters.

```python
print('x' * 32 + 'pwned')
```

Now, by selecting the mode for printing the stack, we will correctly visualize that the `pico` variabile has been replaced with the string `pwned`.
By selecting 4 to check the win, we will eventually get the flag.
