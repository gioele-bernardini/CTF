# Simple Challenges - No Writeup Needed

This report summarizes a set of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges deemed too simple to require a dedicated writeup. The challenges listed below were straightforward enough that a detailed breakdown would be redundant.

> **Note:** The challenge counter has been updated accordingly.

## Challenge List

- **ascii-numbers**
- **useless**
- **chrono**
- **i-wanna-be-a-rockstar**
- **plumbing**
- **based**
- **mus1c**
- **pw-crack-3**
- **pw-crack-4**

Each of these challenges was completed efficiently, with *minimal complexity*, rendering a full report superfluous. Future reports will focus on more challenging tasks that require in-depth analysis and explanation.

>P.s.!

There were *3* challenges extremely hard for me, which do not deserve a writeup (afterall I did not solve either!) but *really* deserve to be kept in mind, just in case something similiar might pop up someday!
