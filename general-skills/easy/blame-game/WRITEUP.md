# Solution

## Explanation

The challenge is straightforward: the goal is to create a brute force program that iterates over each commit hash and checks if reverting to that commit produces a correct state for the code. By iterating from the latest commit backward, we can use the Python interpreter's exit code (`echo $?`) to verify if the code runs without errors. If the exit code is `0`, it indicates successful execution, meaning we've reverted to a commit where the code is in a correct state. 

Example check in bash:
```bash
python test_script.py
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Commit is correct!"
fi
```

This way, the brute force script identifies the last known good commit based on successful execution.
