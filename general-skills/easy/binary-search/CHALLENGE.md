# Binary Search

## Description

```
Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You'll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses. Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics. Practicing the fundamentals manually might help you in the future when you have to write your own tools!
```

## Hints
```
Have you ever played hot or cold? Binary search is a bit like that.
```
```
You have a very limited number of guesses. Try larger jumps between numbers!
